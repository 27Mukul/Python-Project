# Guess the Number Game
This is a simple Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess the number. The program provides feedback to the user on whether their guess was too high or too low, and keeps track of the number of guesses it took the user to find the correct answer.

# How to Use
- Install Python on your computer. You can download it from the official Python website.
- Download or clone the guess-the-number repository to your local machine.
- pen a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the repository.
- Run the following command to start the program:
  ```guess_the_number.py```
- The program will display a welcome message and instructions. Enter your guess and press Enter to see if you guessed correctly.
- The program will provide feedback on whether your guess was too high or too low. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.
- Once you guess the number, the program will display the number of guesses it took you to find the correct answer.

# Requirements
- Install Python on your computer.
- Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write and run the 
code, such as PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or IDLE.
